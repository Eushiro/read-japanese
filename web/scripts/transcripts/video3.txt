0:00 McDonald's hamburger hamburger interesting or interesting
0:17 today I'd like to talk about how Japanese people conceptualize sounds
0:23 understanding how Japanese people recognize and conceptualize sound is very important to speak Japanese with proper Rhythm and accent
0:31 also it helps you to recognize sounds when you are listening to Japanese
0:38 so how Japanese people recognize sounds they grasp sounds using sound the unit code Mora in Japanese it is called Haku
0:49 Haku also means beat in music Every Beat has the same length
0:57 just like Mora in Japanese language so when I say
1:07 every mora in this taxi knowledge is supposed to be equally long even though there are some exceptions in real life conversation
1:16 but basically you should pronounce every mora equally long in Japanese we basically use Mora instead of syllables
1:25 what's the difference between mora and syllables for example hamburger in Japanese is
1:38 well when you say hambaga Han Han is supposed to be one syllable but if you're talking about Mora ha is two moras
1:53 also has two moras ga has two moras
2:03 in Japanese is supposed to have six moras
2:08 if you don't have the concept of Mora say to Japanese people's ears it sounds a little bit weird because you don't pronounce ham long enough supposed to have two moras
2:27 there are three kinds of sounds you should note one is long vowel long vowel is just like you extend the vowel for one more
2:41 if I just say ba ba it is but if I say ba ba it has two moras it's the same when I say
2:58 because this vowel is extended for one more instead of saying I say Gaga
3:05 so it has to moras you should be careful that when you're saying long vowel you should pronounce it for two moras in length
3:16 it often confuses Japanese people when foreigners pronounce long vowel not long enough for example word like ojisan ojisa means Grandpa
3:31 G is a long vowel so you should extend another one more to pronounce it
3:38 but many Foreigner when they're pronouncing this word they hastily say it sounds like different word autism means Uncle it's not grandpa
3:50 so when you're saying this word you should extend D long enough so it sounds like Grandpa not uncle
4:04 the second one is sound can be pronounced as um I will cover this sound in different video
4:13 well for example what like has four moras foreign Learners often pronounce the syllable Khan as one more instead of two therefore it sounds too fast to Japanese ears
4:29 many foreigners say Kan tan like instead of saying
4:46 so you should remember that sound takes up the same length as any other sound
4:52 the last one is sound called sokun sokun is a sound of holding consonant longer something similar to glottal stuff like Saka
5:03 suck is instead of just saying Saka Saka well Saka has two moras but if I say has three moras
5:17 this topping part in the middle is called sokun so this is how Japanese people recognize sounds
5:25 when they hear some English words like computer they convert it into moras computer in Japanese is computer
5:38 so they convert it into KO um pew uh ah long vowel computer so it has six moras
5:49 when they hear English word like interesting interesting Japanese people convert the sound into moras
6:01 so interesting will be um so it has in total of eight moras
6:13 this is one of the reasons why Japanese pronunciation of some English words sounds funny they have different Rhythm
6:21 that's also why Japanese people generally have trouble learning English if your mother tongue is Japanese then you have this mora system installed in your sound recognition system
6:35 installing a new sound recognition system is not an easy task so for Japanese people learning English is a very difficult thing
6:43 the same thing can be said if your mother tongue is English because you have different sound recognition system installed in your head
6:52 so you would have some trouble listening to or speaking Japanese in the next video I'll prepare some exercises so you can get used to Japanese mora system
